hmm, so the Asian chars were totally wrong ?

Since this is a port from the perl version, I assume the perl version is correct. I don't have any knowledge of Asian languages, so I can't check this.

Maybe @l3pp4rd knows more about this, since he ported this implementation to PHP in his DoctrineExtensions.

Can you fix the escaping issues ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by WouterSioen at 2014-09-04T10:36:53Z

I'll check it.

I fixed some escaping issues, but I'll have to check some items with a lot of escaping characters and quotes (like in bankfile x1f.php).

@WouterSioen I'm doing a review of all files currently, to see if I spot stuff you forgot. No need to fix immediately, you can wait until I'm done to do it in a single pass instead

Ok, I'll wait for fixing your upcoming comments.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by stof at 2014-09-04T11:52:21Z

OK, done

Fixed
